# PIC16B-Project

The following repository is for the final project for the course PIC 16B, Lecture 2 taken at UCLA during the Fall of 2023. The most important files for the project are located under the "Project_Main" folder, where the folder "FinalGroupProjectSubmission" contains the "index.ipynb" file with a general overview of the project and its methods.

The project aims to look at delay propogation within the LA Metro Network. We implement various modules present within the Python language, such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and NetworkX to provide a good picture of how the rail network within this metropolitan area are most likely to be impacted given the occurence of delays.

For the general user, you may consider looking at the various .ipynb files present in the Project_Main directory and the .py files holding corresponding functions used, as well as other aptly labeled directories to get a feel for what the project entails. The python script titled "scraping_script.py" may be run via the CLI of your computer to understand the process of webscraping automation. Furthermore, consider reading the "index.ipynb" file in full to get a good idea of the project's entire overview.

You may clone the repo on your local machine via "git clone https://github.com/sreejeetsreenivasan/PIC16B-Project.git"
